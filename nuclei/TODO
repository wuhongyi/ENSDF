Open Bugs:
- n.a.

Improvements
- Peak color in energy spectra should not depend on order of highlighting but on population/depopulation

Feature requests:
- Allow (at least temporary) changes to nuclear data to fix calculations for user-fixed data

Nuclide Search
- Allow to auto-skip levels with short half-life in cascade search
- Allow to limit search on nuclides where N-1 is stable (for neutron reactions)
- Allow to limit search for nuclides with reasonably high N-1 fraction in natural isotope mix and sufficient cross section for pulsed neutron activation
- Search facilities for n-gamma measurements

Others
- Add conversion x-rays in photo peak plot
- Allow to auto-skip levels with short half-life in cascade selection
- Sort mass chain according to Z (in the tree on the left)
